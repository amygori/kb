# What is Sass?

---

# Sass variables

```scss
$font-stack:    Helvetica, sans-serif;
$primary-color: #333;

body {
  font: 100% $font-stack;
  color: $primary-color;
}
```

---

# @import and partials

`@import` pulls in the content of another file into your Sass file. Partials -- Sass files not compiled on their own -- start their file names with `_`, like `_colors.scss`.

---

# Nesting

```scss
.menu {
  list-style: none;

  li {
    display: inline-block;
  }

  a {
    text-decoration: none;
  }
}
```

---

# The `&` operator

```scss
a {
  text-decoration: none;

  &:hover {
    background-color: blue;
    color: white;
  }
}
```

# About BEM

* Created at Yandex in 2005
* Everything is a class
* Nothing is nested
* Lots of variations online -- we use getbem.com

---

# Blocks

A block is a standalone entity that is meaningful on its own.

* `.menu`
* `.profile`
* `.post`
* `.footer`

---

# Block elements

An element is a part of a block that has no standalone meaning and is semantically tied to its block.

* `.menu__item`
* `.profile__photo`
* `.post__author`
* `.footer__logo`

---

# Modifiers

A modifier is a flag on a block or element to indicate a variant.

* `.post--latest`
* `.menu__item--active`
* `.menu__item--disabled`

---

# Exercise

Take the dog adoption site from week 1 and identify BEM elements.
