# Assignments

Monday through Wednesday, you will have a daily project to work on. On Thursday, you'll get a longer weekend project assignment. We'll often refer to assignments as "homework," even though you'll do a lot of this work here in the lab.

## Getting an assignment

Each day, you'll be invited via email to accept an assignment via GitHub classroom. Your assignment will be in the repo's README.

### Daily Assignments

We'll introduce each day's homework early in the day during class time. We'll discuss them in class and use them to frame our exploration of the day's topics. You'll begin working on the assignment during afternoon lab time. You can expect to spend 4-6 hours each day working on it. Homework is due before the start of class the next morning.

### Weekly Projects

On Thursday, you'll get a longer, more involved project to work on that afternoon, on lab day on Friday, and through the weekend. It will be due on Monday morning before the start of class. These projects will sometimes be done in pairs or groups.

## Working on assignments

### 1. Understand the assignment

Before you start, be sure you understand the assignment. Being able to restate what you're being asked to do in your own words will clarify what you need to do and help you create a task list.

### 2. Break a large task down into smaller ones

This is an absolutely necessary step that is worth spending some thinking about. _Careful planning can save you a lot of development time._ You'll find it much more manageable to work from a developer task list and do one thing at a time. Working from your restatement of the assignment, identify steps that you will need to take to get to completion. Then, go over your steps and see if those steps can be broken down into smaller ones.

Start with one step. It doesn't have to be the first one. Work on something you know you can do, and build from there.

### 2. Write code

Once you know what you need to do, it's tempting to start with research, but instead, start with trying to write some code. Push yourself to rely on your understanding before you look things up.

This trial-and-error technique can feel inefficient, and it can feel really slow at first. Don't worry about that too much.

1. Write a line or a few lines of code.
2. _RUN THE CODE_ (in the browser, or the console, or whatever).
3. If it ran and did what you wanted, great! Start over at step #1.
4. If it didn't run, or the outcome wasn't right, change the code and run it again.

You want to establish a quick feedback loop. Running the code will generate results -- an error or an outcome -- and that is great! It's information about what you need to do next.

When we learn about test-driven development (TDD), you'll learn about doing this in a more formal way, writing and running tests of the code you write.

### 3. Google

Google everything, and get to know what resources are reliable. Copy and paste error messages you're getting. Read documentation, but don't get bogged down in reading articles or blog posts. Practice skimming, find an idea, and try it out.

Knowing what to Google takes some time, but with continued practice, it will get easier to find the right words and phrases to search for.

### 4. Take a break

At a certain point, it is no longer fruitful to continue focusing on a problem. Your brain needs time to rest.

We're in a great spot for walks, so be sure to get outside when you need a break. Take a real lunch break. Go outside, sit with your colleagues and friends, and take some time away from your work.

When you come back to it, you'll have a fresh perspective and new ideas.

## Submitting Assignments

After you accept the assignment in GitHub Classroom, you'll write code and push commits to your own assignment repo, and  submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) to the upstream assignment repo.

### Knowing when to quit at the end of the day

We don't want you to stay up all night. When to turn in homework is your call, but remember that it does not have to be perfect.

### Pull Requests

Your pull request should always include the following in the notes section:

- The score you'd give your own work (is it a 1 or a 2? see ##Scoring below)
- An explanation of what still needs work if you gave it a 1
- At least one question you'd like to ask about this homework

## Scoring

Assignments are scored from 0-2.

0: The assignment is not turned in, or what was turned in cannot be scored.

1: The assignment needs more work to demonstrate that you've understood the material.

2: The assignment meets the standard and shows an understanding of the material.

Since all assignments are turned in via pull requests on GitHub, it can help to think of the scale in terms of pull request actions.

- 0: rejected
- 1: changes requested
- 2: accepted
