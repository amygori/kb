# What is React?

- Created by Facebook, open-sourced in 2013
- Primarily used to make single-page applications
- Lets you create user interfaces that update automatically when your data changes

---

# How does React work?

---

# What problem does it solve?

- Automatically updates HTML to reflect your current application state
- React components can propagate changes to their children
- Minimizes necessary updates through the Virtual DOM and diffing

---

# Starting a React app

We are going to use [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app#creating-an-app) for building React apps. 

```
npm install -g create-react-app
```

**We are using this instead of Parcel.** It works similarly, but uses Webpack under the hood, so there are some differences.

---

# Starting a React app, part 2

To create a React app, run:

```
create-react-app <directory>
```

where `<directory>` is the directory you want to create the app in.

---

```
$ create-react-app sample-app

Creating a new React app in /private/tmp/sample-app.

Installing packages. This might take a couple of minutes.
Installing react, react-dom, and react-scripts...

Success! Created sample-app at /private/tmp/sample-app
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  yarn start
    Starts the development server.

  yarn test
    Starts the test runner.

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd sample-app
  yarn start

Happy hacking!
```

# What's yarn?

[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) is a replacement for NPM created by Facebook. It is meant to be faster and more secure than NPM. It originally was, but a lot of Yarn's features have been rolled into NPM. Use either one.

To install: `brew install yarn`

# Some import stuff to get used to

From `index.js`:

```js
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import './index.css'
```

What is that last line and how does it work?

---

# JSX

```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react'
import logo from './logo.svg'

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <header className="App-header">
          <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
          <h1 className="App-title">Welcome to React</h1>
        </header>
        <p className="App-intro">
          To get started, edit <code>src/App.js</code> and save to reload.
        </p>
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

---

# JSX

JSX allows you to construct HTML in JavaScript. Under the hood, everything is being converted to JavaScript objects and functions.

```js
React.createElement('div', {className: "App"}, 
  React.createElement('header', {className: "App-header"}, 
    React.createElement('img', 
      {src: logo, className: 'App-logo', alt: 'logo'}),
    React.createElement('h1', 
      {className: 'App-title'}, 'Welcome to React')
  )
)
```

---

# Using JSX

* Write HTML, with some caveats:
  * You need **one** top-level element.
  * Use `className` instead of `class`.
  * Use `htmlFor` instead of `for` on labels.
  * `if` and `for` don't work inside of JSX. Everything must be an expression with a return value. Use `?:`, `&&`, `||`, and `.map`.
* `{}` evaluates its content as JavaScript.

---

# State

React components keep their state in `this.state`.

To set state, use `this.setState()`. This will trigger a re-render.

---

```jsx
class Switch extends React.Component {
  constructor () {
    super()
    this.state = {
      status: 'off'
    }
  }

  setSwitch (status) {
    this.setState({
      status: status
    })
  }

  render () {
    return (<div>
      <button onClick={e => this.setSwitch('on')}>Turn on</button>
      <button onClick={e => this.setSwitch('off')}>Turn off</button>
    </div>)
  }
}
```

---

```jsx
class Clicker extends React.Component {
  constructor () {
    super()
    this.state = {
      clicks: 0
    }
  }

  clickButton () {
    this.setState(prevState => ({
      clicks: prevState.clicks + 1
    }))
  }

  render () {
    return (<div>
      <h1>Hello!</h1>
      <p>You have clicked this button {this.state.clicks} times.</p>
      <button onClick={e => this.clickButton()}>Click me</button>
    </div>)
  }
}
```

# Events

Note in the previous examples, we used `onClick` on JSX tags. We use this instead of `addEventListener` with React. See [Handling Events](https://reactjs.org/docs/handling-events.html) for some tips and [the list of events](https://reactjs.org/docs/events.html) to see what's supported.
