# OOP with Phones


We'll create a program to store information about people and their cell phones.

## Criteria

We want a structure to keep track of phones (with their model names and selected ringtones), people (with their names), and information about which person owns which phone.  We should be able to:

* Create a new phone (once you know its model and ringtone).
* Make the phone ring (which will `puts` out the phone's ringtone).
* Create a new person (once you know their name and which phone they own).
* Make the person say their name (which will `puts` "My name is ...").
* Let the person receive a call (ie, the person's phone should ring).
